# Palindrome Checker

## Description
This project utilises JS, HTML and CSS to check if what the user inputs into the box is a palindrome or not. The input takes any characters including spaces and will return whether it is a palindrome (spaces are ignored but are taken).
A challenge during this project was making the JS code ignore cases before reversing and checking the input. A potential interesting addition to this project could be to implement the ability to check for palindromes in other languages.

This project was done as part of learning JS in freeCodeCamp.
